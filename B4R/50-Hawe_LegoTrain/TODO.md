### NEW: ESP32 BLE BrickController.
Instead controlling the train with LEGO® PowerFunctions & LEGO® IR Receiver use a Brick with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), like LEGO® HUB No4 or BuWizz 2. 

This means the ESP32 could act as a BrickController between the BLE Brick and Home Assistant, but also also to control other devices like servos to control switches.

Communication: BLE Brick <--> BLE message <--> ESP32 BLE & WiFi & MQTT <--> Home Assistant MQTT
#### Status
Not started.
