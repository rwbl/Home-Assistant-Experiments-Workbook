### NEW: ESP32 BLE BrickController.
Instead PowerFunctions with IR use a Brick with BLE, like LEGOÂ® HUB No4 or BuWizz 2.
This means the ESP32 could act as a BrickController between the BLE Brick and Home Assistant.
BLE Brick <--> BLE message <--> ESP32 BLE & WiFi & MQTT <--> Home Assistant MQTT
#### Status
Not started.
