# Experiment 50-HaWe_LEGO_Train (B4R)

**Project: Home Assistant Workbook Experiments**

## Brief

This is an educational project to control a LEGO® Power Functions train using an ESP32 (B4R) and a Home Assistant (HA) Lovelace dashboard.  
It demonstrates HTTP & MQTT communication, infrared control of the LEGO® 8884 IR receiver, and cross-platform client development.  

In short, this is an **ESP32 & B4R-powered LEGO® Train Controller (HTTP & IR)**.

## TrainController (ESP32 Firmware)

- Sends IR commands via KY-005 LED to LEGO® Power Functions 8884 IR receiver.
- Supports:
  - HTTP & MQTT communication.
  - IR communication.

## MQTT

The Home Assistant [MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) is used to communicate between the TrainController and Home Assistant.  
The list of topics and payloads is below.

### Availability

#### Purpose
Set the availability state.

#### Topic
```
homeassistant/light/hawe/legotrain/availability
```

#### Payload
```
online
```

### Config: Speed Control

#### Purpose
MQTT discovery configuration for a Light entity to control speed.  
Uses **brightness** as speed (0–100%).

#### Topic
```
homeassistant/light/hawe_legotrain_speed/config
```

#### Payload
```json
{
  "name": "HaWe LEGO Train",
  "object_id": "hawe_legotrain_speed",
  "unique_id": "hawe_legotrain_speed",
  "schema": "json",
  "state_topic": "hawe/legotrain/speed/state",
  "command_topic": "hawe/legotrain/speed/set",
  "brightness": true,
  "supported_color_modes": ["brightness"],
  "device_class": "light",
  "device": {
    "identifiers": ["legotrain"],
    "name": "HaWe LEGO Train"
  }
}
```

### Message: Get Speed

#### Purpose
Get train speed state.

#### Topic
```
hawe/legotrain/speed/state
```

### Message: Set Speed

#### Purpose
Set the train speed.

#### Topic
```
hawe/legotrain/speed/set
```

#### Payload Example
```json
{"state":"ON","brightness":79}
```

#### Examples
Set speed to 79%:
```
[MQTT_MessageArrived] topic=hawe/legotrain/speed/set, payload={"state":"ON","brightness":79}
```

Emergency stop:
```
[MQTT_MessageArrived] topic=hawe/legotrain/speed/set, payload={"state":"OFF"}
```

### Config: Direction Control

#### Purpose
MQTT discovery configuration for a Switch entity to control train direction.

#### Topic
```
homeassistant/switch/hawe_legotrain_direction/config
```

#### Payload
```json
{
  "name": "HaWe LEGO Train Direction",
  "object_id": "hawe_legotrain_direction",
  "unique_id": "hawe_legotrain_direction",
  "state_topic": "hawe/legotrain/direction/state",

## MQTT Tips

Remove retained topics from the MQTT broker using Mosquitto clients.
Experienced that the best was is to use the mosquitto client `mosquitto_sub`.
This will automatically remove the entity from Home Assistant.
Checkout the entities list http://<home assistant-ip:port>/config/entities
**Command**
```
<path>\mosquitto_pub -h <broker_ip> -u "<user>" -P "<pass>" -t "<topic>" -n -r
```
**Example**
Remove the entity `hawe_legotrain_speed'.

1. List config topics using wildcard `+`:
```
<path>\mosquitto\mosquitto_sub -h <broker_ip> -u "<user>" -P "<pass>" -t "homeassistant/light/+/config" -v
```

2. Search for the related config topic:
```
homeassistant/light/hawe_legotrain_speed/config
```
like
```
homeassistant/light/hawe_legotrain_speed/config
{"name":"HaWe LegoTrain Speed","object_id":"hawe_legotrain_speed","unique_id":"hawe_legotrain_speed","schema":"json","state_topic":"hawe/legotrain/speed/state","command_topic":"hawe/legotrain/speed/set","brightness":true,"supported_color_modes":["brightness"],"device_class":"light","device":{"identifiers":["legotrain"],"name":"Hawe LEGO Train"}}
```

3. Remove the config topic
```
<path>\mosquitto_pub -h <broker_ip> -u "<user>" -P "<pass>" -t "homeassistant/light/hawe_legotrain_speed/config" -n -r
```

4. Check Home Assistant Entities List
The entity `hawe_legotrain_speed`should be removed.

## Home Assistant Setup

### HaWe LEGO Train Speed Gauge

Define a gauge showing the speed on the HA Lovelace Dashboard.

**Folder:**
```
homeassistant/hawe/sensors/template/hawe_legotrain.yaml
```

**YAML:**
```yaml
sensor:
  - name: "HaWe LEGO Train Speed"
    unique_id: "hawe_legotrain_speed"
    unit_of_measurement: "km/h"
    icon: mdi:speedometer
    state: >
      {% set l = states.light.hawe_legotrain_speed %}
      {% if l is not none and 'brightness' in l.attributes %}
        {% set b = l.attributes.brightness | int(0) %}
        {% if b == 0 %}
          0
        {% else %}
          {{ ((b / 255) * 100) | round(0, 'common') }}
        {% endif %}
      {% else %}
        0
      {% endif %}
```

**Include in configuration.yaml:**
```yaml
template:
  - !include hawe/sensors/template/hawe_legotrain.yaml
```

### HaWe Lovelace Dashboard

    cards:
      - type: light
        entity: light.hawe_legotrain_speed
        name: LEGO Train
        icon: mdi:train
      - type: entities
        title: Direction
        entities:
          - entity: switch.hawe_legotrain_direction
            name: Direction (OFF = Forward, ON = Reverse)
      - type: entities
        title: Headlights
        entities:
          - entity: switch.hawe_legotrain_headlights
            name: Headlights
  - type: gauge
    entity: sensor.hawe_legotrain_speed
    name: Train Speed
    min: 0
    max: 100
    severity:
      green: 0
      yellow: 60
      red: 80
  - show_name: true
    show_icon: true
    type: button
    name: Emergency Stop
    icon: mdi:stop-circle-outline
    tap_action:
      action: call-service
      service: light.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: light.hawe_legotrain_speed
```

## Getting Started

Changes required before use (in `Constants.h` in `src/TrainController`):
- Set Wi-Fi credentials in `WIFI` namespace.
- Set MQTT broker IP address in `MQTT` namespace.
- Set target communication (Wi-Fi and/or MQTT).
- Implement YAML sensors & dashboard configuration in Home Assistant.
- Copy the rPowerFunctionsEx library to the B4R additional libraries folder (see folder `B4R/Libraries`).
