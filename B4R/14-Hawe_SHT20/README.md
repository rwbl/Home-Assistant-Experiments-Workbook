# Hawe SHT20 — ESP32 MQTT Sensor Integration with Home Assistant

This experiment reads temperature, humidity, and dewpoint from an SHT20 sensor connected to an ESP32 board. It integrates with Home Assistant (HA) via MQTT using both:

- **Automatic periodic updates** every 60 seconds
- **Manual on-demand request** via a Lovelace button

All values are auto-discovered in HA using the MQTT Discovery protocol.

## Hardware

| Component      | Details                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Microcontroller | ESP-WROOM-32                        |
| Sensor          | SHT20 Module (ELV PAD4)             |
| Power           | 3V3 directly from ESP32              |

### Wiring

| SHT20 Pin | ESP32 Pin | Color   |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| VCC       | 3V3       | Red     |
| GND       | GND       | Black   |

## MQTT Topics

| Purpose              | Topic                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Temperature (state)  | `hawe/sht20/temperature/state` |
| Humidity (state)     | `hawe/sht20/humidity/state`    |
| Dewpoint (state)     | `hawe/sht20/dewpoint/state`    |
| Availability         | `homeassistant/sensor/hawe/sht20/availability` |
| On-demand request    | `hawe/sht20/get`               |

MQTT Discovery topics are also published for HA auto-setup.

## Home Assistant Integration

### Auto-Discovery
All sensors (temperature, humidity, dewpoint) are auto-discovered via MQTT when retained config messages are not found.

### Lovelace Button Card (for on-demand reading)

Add this YAML to any dashboard:

```yaml
type: button
name: Get SHT20 Data
icon: mdi:refresh
tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: mqtt.publish
  data:
    topic: hawe/sht20/get
    payload: request
show_name: true
show_icon: true
```

When pressed, HA sends a request via MQTT, triggering an immediate sensor read and state update.

---

## Data Reporting Interval

Sensor values are published every **60 seconds** via a measurement timer.

---

## Diagnostics & Logging

- Serial output via USB shows startup logs and sensor read results.
- Logs also indicate whether MQTT discovery config was received or sent.

---

## Notes

- The system waits for retained MQTT config before starting regular measurements.
- Dewpoint is calculated using the SHT20’s temperature and humidity values.
- The request topic must be subscribed to enable manual reads from HA.
- If MQTT config is not found within 60 seconds, it is re-published to HA.
