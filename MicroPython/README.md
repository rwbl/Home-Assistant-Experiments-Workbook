# Hawe Experiment: Hawe_SolarInfo_OLED

This folder contains the MicroPython code and resources for the **Hawe_SolarInfo_OLED** experiment, part of the Hawe (Home Assistant Workbook Experiments) series.

---

## 📋 Description

This experiment reads live solar power data from a Home Assistant production system via MQTT and displays it on a 0.96" 4-pin white OLED (I2C).  
Data is published from the HA production system via a Node-RED REST/MQTT bridge and visualized on the development system.

## 🔄 Prepare Node-RED

A Node-RED flow is required to collect solar info data in JSON format.  
The flow runs every minute and the output of the flow publishes a JSON string to the HA entity:  
`hawe/solar_info/helper`.

**Example Output**
```json
{
    "power_to_house": 161,
    "power_date_stamp": 20250620,
    "power_from_solar": 3306,
    "power_from_grid": 0,
    "power_to_grid": 3145,
    "power_time_stamp": 753,
    "power_battery_charge": 100,
    "power_to_battery": 0,
    "power_from_battery": 0
}
```

## ▶️ Usage

1. Edit `secrets.py` with your WiFi and MQTT configuration.
2. Upload all files to your Raspberry Pi Pico W using Thonny or ampy.
3. Connect the OLED to the correct I2C pins (see wiring below).
4. Run `hawe_solarinfo_oled.py` on the board.
5. View solar data in real time on the OLED display.

## 🔌 Wiring

### OLED 0.96" I2C Display

| OLED Pin | Connect to Pico Pin      | Note (wire color) |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **GND**  | GND                      | Ground (Black)    |
| **VCC**  | 3.3V (NOT 5V!)           | Power (Red)       |
| **SCL**  | GP27 (physical pin 32)   | I2C Clock (Green) |
| **SDA**  | GP26 (physical pin 31)   | I2C Data (Blue)   |
| **I2C**  | Address 0x3c, Channel: 1 |

> ⚠️ **Important**: If the OLED freezes or throws `[Errno 5] EIO`, unplug and replug the board to reset I2C hardware.

## 📺 Display Example

```
| S:1553W | G:0W    |
| H:230W  | T:1323W |
| B:+0W   | L:100%  |
|                    |
|2025-06-19 11:10    |
```

- `S` = Solar
- `G` = Grid
- `H` = House
- `T` = To Grid
- `B` = Battery Flow
- `L` = Battery Level (%)

---

## 🛠️ Notes

- Display will auto-refresh on every MQTT update.
- If OLED is not connected, script continues with MQTT logging only.
- OLED I2C detection includes fallback safety.
- Option: enhance formatting with icons, arrows, or blinking alerts.

---

## ✍️ ToDo

- Enhance formatting with icons, arrows, or blinking alerts.
