# Hawe MicroPython Experiments

Welcome to the **Hawe MicroPython Experiments** collection!

This folder contains a series of self-contained MicroPython projects designed for IoT and embedded development using MicroPython-compatible boards. Each experiment focuses on specific sensors, actuators, or communication protocols, providing a hands-on way to explore and learn step-by-step.

Each experiment subfolder includes its own README.md with detailed documentation.

The **Imports/** folder contains reusable Python modules shared across experiments.

The **Tools/** folder contains useful MicroPython scripts such as I2C scanner utilities and scripts to remove MQTT discovery topics.
