# 🧪 Home Assistant Workbook - Experiment Hawe_EnvSim

This **Hawe** experiment simulates environment sensor values — **temperature**, **humidity**, and **pressure** — and publishes them via **MQTT** to **Home Assistant** using MQTT Discovery.

This is useful for developing and testing automation logic without connecting real hardware sensors.

---

## 🛰️ Simulation Overview

- Random values generated for:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Pressure (hPa)
- Sent every 10 seconds
- Exposed as standard Home Assistant sensor entities
- No hardware or wiring required

---

## 🔌 Hardware

- 🧠 **Microcontroller**: Raspberry Pi Pico W or ESP32
- 🧪 **Sensor**: None – simulated via software

## 📡 MQTT Topics

Configured in `secrets.py`:

- **Discovery prefix**: `homeassistant`
- **Base topic**: `hawe`

> 🧠 MQTT Discovery format:  
> `homeassistant/<component>/<unique_id>/config`

## 🧩 Entities in Home Assistant

The following sensor entities are automatically created by Home Assistant:

```
sensor.hawe_envsim_temperature
sensor.hawe_envsim_humidity
sensor.hawe_envsim_pressure
```


---

## 🖼️ Example Home Assistant Card

```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: sensor.hawe_envsim_temperature
    name: Temperature
    secondary_info: last-changed
  - entity: sensor.hawe_envsim_humidity
    name: Humidity
    secondary_info: last-changed
  - entity: sensor.hawe_envsim_pressure
    name: Pressure
    secondary_info: last-changed
title: Hawe EnvSim
```

## Code Behavior Summary
- Connects to Wi-Fi
- Connects to MQTT broker
- Publishes MQTT Discovery topics
- Every 10 seconds:
	- Randomly generates simulated sensor values
	- Publishes temperature, humidity, and pressure via MQTT
    - Home Assistant auto-creates sensor entities based on discovery
