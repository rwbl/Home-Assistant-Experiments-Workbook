"""
hawe_pico_status/button.py

Explanation:
- Home Assistant loads __init__.py on integration setup (configuration.yaml references this).
- It then runs async_setup_platform() in button.py to register the two buttons.
- When pressed, each button sends an MQTT message to a specific topic.
- The Pico device subscribes to these topics and reacts accordingly (e.g. publishing status or toggling LED).
- All actual logic is handled on the device side â€” Home Assistant just sends commands.
