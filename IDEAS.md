# 💡 IDEAS – Hawe Project Inspiration

## 🔧 New Experiments

- 🌈 `HaWeNeoMatrix`: Use WS2812B matrix for animations
- 🕹️ `HaWeJoystick`: Analog joystick mapped to MQTT x/y
- 🔉 `HaWeBuzzer`: Play melodies or alarms triggered from HA
- 💡 `HaWeSceneSwitch`: Rotary switch or button for triggering Home Assistant scenes
- 📏 `HaWeCaliper`: Digital caliper MQTT encoder
- 🌦️ `HaWeWeather`: Combine sensors for a compact weather station

## 🤝 Collaboration

- Create a “plug-in” system for loading experiments like modules
- Enable loading different `.py` files via MQTT command topic
- Share community experiment templates and test cases

## 🌐 Integration Targets

- Add optional **ESPHome equivalents** for each Hawe experiment
- Integrate with **InfluxDB** and **Grafana** for advanced visualization
- Provide **Node-RED** flow templates for selected experiments

## 📖 Learning Paths

- "From Blink to Automation" – a guided path using Hawe chapters
- Home Assistant automation exercises (using scripts or dashboards)
- MicroPython patterns for beginners (loop vs timer, state machine, etc.)

## ⚙️ Utilities & Scripts

- Python script to purge retained MQTT config/state topics
- MQTT stress test: send many entities in rapid succession
- Pico-to-Pico communication via MQTT bridge experiment
